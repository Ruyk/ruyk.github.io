Hola! I am _Ruyman Reyes Castro_. I love leading teams through challenges using agile methodologies and solving complex technical challenges.
As CTO of Codeplay Software, I led the growth and reorganization of our engineering teams, guided strategic projects based on open standards like SYCL, 
and played a key role in our acquisition by Intel, working to align our teams and technology with broader industry efforts.
I have a strong background as a software Engineer with background in HPC and extensive experience in programming models and heterogeneous platforms.

I hold a PhD from University of La Laguna (Spain). I completed my dissertation, named [Directive based approach to Heterogeneous Computing](https://riull.ull.es/xmlui/handle/915/106), in December 2012, while working as Application Developer in the [Edinburgh Parallel Computing Center (EPCC)](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk). I moved later in December 2013 to [Codeplay Software](http://www.codeplay.com) as Research Engineer,
where I started working in the SYCL programming language, which is now a Khronos standard.
Within Codeplay I moved from the Research team to the ComputeCpp product, leading the ComputeCpp team (9+ people) coordinating the work on the SYCL and C++ standards while building the ComputeCpp product and shipping it to customers.
With Codeplay receiving $3M funding from Foresight in 2018, I took on expanding the team to 15 engineers running various SYCL applications and libraries.
Then I started the SYCL NVIDIA backend for DPC++ which was upstreamed to the DPC++ compiler as part of the OneAPI multi vendor efforts.
I grew the team to 10 people to deliver the NVIDIA supoprt to DPC++, oneDNN and oneMKL, which was later on expanded to AMD support as well.
In 2020 I became CTO of Codeplay, taking over the technical direction of the Company (85 engineers at the time), including reorganizing the software engineering teams to work with a product mindset.
During my time as CTO we delivered several customer projects for AI and automotive accelerators, using our vertical software stack based on open standards (SYCL, OpenCL).
While looking for the next investment round we quickly found that various companies were interested in acquiring Codeplay to enhance their portfolio, so I worked with
Andrew Richards (CEO) and Charles Macfarlane (CBO) preparing investment and sales pitch, and presenting to various companies our technology stack, plans and roadmaps.
We successfully exited in 2022 with an acquisition from Intel, our strategic partner since 2018. 
After acquisition I took lead of the integration and realignment of the teams, working closely with Intel M&A and Developer Software Tools to connect Codeplay teams and software stack
to various projects, aligning strategies and moving OneAPI onto a multi-vendor standard. 
We open sourced our Codeplay tecnology into the OneAPI construction Kit, which is now available for any Hardware company to use on their systems and deploy oneAPI on them at low cost.
We achieved several internal awards for collaboration and succesfully retained the team while delivering all milestones with minimal friction despite of the big cultural differences.
Once Codeplay projects were settled and teams properly functional, I started working on OneAPI strategy for CUDA to SYCL migration, looking at how to improve tooling to ease user migration 
to Intel platforms. This collaboration with Codeplay and Intel engineers analyzing the developer experience porting applications led to several important learnings, of which two of them led
to new projects: The [SYCL backend for llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/ggml/src/ggml-sycl) and the [CUTLASS SYCL implementation](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/cutlass-sycl).
Both projects demonstrate the possibility of migrating or porting CUDA AI applications to oneAPI with high performance via community cooperation and developer engagement.

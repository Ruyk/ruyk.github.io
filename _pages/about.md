I’m Ruyman Reyes Castro, CTO of Codeplay Software. I enjoy leading teams through complex technical challenges and building scalable solutions using agile methods and open standards.

I hold a PhD in heterogeneous computing from the University of La Laguna. My career began at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC), and in 2013 I joined Codeplay, where I contributed to the early development of SYCL and led the ComputeCpp product team. Over the years, I helped scale the engineering from 9 to over 20 people, led major cross-vendor projects including SYCL support for NVIDIA and AMD, and worked closely with industry partners as part of the oneAPI initiative.

As CTO, I guided our technical strategy through significant growth, customer delivery, and ultimately our acquisition by Intel. Post-acquisition, I led team integration and helped align Codeplay’s stack with Intel’s developer tools ecosystem. I continue to focus on developer experience and performance portability, including recent open-source contributions like SYCL backends for AI workloads.
While working within Developer Software Tools organization, I participated in the direction of the oneAPI strategy, migration from CUDA and collaboration with the UXL foundation.
Two of the most interesting projects I've started and guided have been the [SYCL backend for llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/ggml/src/ggml-sycl) and the [CUTLASS SYCL implementation](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/cutlass-sycl). Both projects demonstrate the possibility of migrating or porting CUDA AI applications to oneAPI with high performance via community cooperation and developer engagement.
